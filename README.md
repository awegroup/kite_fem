Fast Structural Modeling of a Leading Edge Inflatable Kite

## Installation Instructions

### Building on Linux: Fedora/RHEL

`pyfe3d` uses Cython to build C++ extensions and links against the static C++ runtime.  
On Fedora/RHEL systems, you need to install the following packages before building:

```bash
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ python3-devel libgomp libstdc++-static
```

Without these, the build may fail with errors like:

```bash
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lstdc++
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
```

### Building on Ubuntu/Debian

**this has not been tested yet...**

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, the static libstdc++ is not shipped as a package.
In that case, it is usually better to remove the -static flags in the pyfe3d build configuration
or use a prebuilt wheel if available. You will still need the standard development toolchain:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev g++ libgomp1
```

### Building on Windows

....?


1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/awegroup/kite_fem
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:
    ```bash
    cd kite_fem
    ```
    
3. Create a virtual environment:
   
   Linux or Mac:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    
    Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    
4. Activate the virtual environment:

   Linux or Mac:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Windows
    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

5. Install the required dependencies:

   For users:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```
        
   For developers:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[dev]
    ```
    
    For ubuntu add:
    ```
    pip instal pyqt5
    sudo apt install cm-super
    sudo apt install dvipng
   ```

6. To deactivate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
